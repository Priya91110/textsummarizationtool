Early Life
Pratap Singh was born to Maharana Udai Singh II and Maharani Jaiwanta Bai. He was the eldest son among 25 sons and was designated as the crown prince of Mewar. However, his ascension to the throne was not without challenges. His stepmother, Dheer Bai, wanted her own son, Jagmal, to become the king. Nevertheless, after Udai Singh II's death in 1572, the nobles of Mewar chose Pratap to be their king, recognizing his bravery and leadership qualities.
